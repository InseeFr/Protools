#### Configuration

As for now, the production environment does not allow us to use environment variables, which greatly annoys us.
A temporary (and outdated) solution is to use a configuration file, which is located in the `public` folder.
For now it is only used to set the API URL.

```json
{
	"API_URL": "http://localhost:8080/"
}
```
